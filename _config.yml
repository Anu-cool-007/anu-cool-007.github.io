  desc: I'm a Senior Undergradute student in the Computer Science department at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am broadly interested in Networking, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am passionate about coding and learning new things in life which are mostly related to computer science, physics and universe. Apart from academic pursuits, in free time I like to watch anime and videos from vsauce and some other science channels. Other than that I like to play Badminton, chess, cricket and love to swim.
